# Web-Design-Project
This project is intended to show a semi-functional blog where the user sees our personal opinions on music. A blog like this is less so meant for a wider audience and more for a smaller niche 
that understands and knows the people behind it (in this case, Bardha and Bujar) :)
As of right now, it consists of HTML, CSS and a little bit of Js, which the latter was used for form validation and making a functional quiz.
