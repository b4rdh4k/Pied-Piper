            <p><strong>Title/Role:</strong>Student<br>
                <strong>Introduction:</strong> Hello there, I'm Bardha, a student at UBT. With a knack for Computer Science, I am committed to making it in the industry.<br>
                <strong>Background:</strong> Originally from Prizren, I bring 1 year of experience in this field. My journey in Front End began in 2020 with a certification as a Front-End Developer from Digital School of Kosova.<br>
                <strong>Mission:</strong> With Pied Piper, our mission was to make a simple website that meets the criteria and is also fun. I strongly believe in work with excitement, and it shapes my every endeavor.<br>
                <strong>What Sets Us Apart:</strong> What makes us unique is our care free, yet planned approach. We take pride in our ability to research and figuring things out.<br>
                <strong>Passions:</strong> Beyond tech, my heart beats for binge watching. In my downtime, you'll catch me watching sitcoms.
