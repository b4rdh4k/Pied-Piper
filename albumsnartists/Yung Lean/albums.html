                        Yung Lean has also explored different musical genres and pseudonyms. Under the name Jonatan Leandoer96, he released albums such as "Nectar" in 2019, "Blodhundar & Lullabies" in 2020, and "Sugar World" in 2023. These projects deviate from his hip-hop roots, incorporating elements of indie rock and neofolk into his musical repertoire. Yung Lean's versatility and innovative approach to music have contributed to his enduring influence in the music industry.
                        Yung Lean's versatility extends beyond hip-hop; he serves as the vocalist for the post-punk band Död Mark, alongside fellow Sad Boys member Gud. The duo released their debut album, "Drabbad av Sjukdom," in 2016 through the Stockholm label YEAR0001. This diversification highlights Yung Lean's ability to navigate and contribute to various musical genres.
