                        West's first six solo albums—The College Dropout (2004), Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), 808s & Heartbreak (2008), My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and Yeezus (2013)—were included on Rolling Stone's 2020 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. The same publication named him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. In addition to his solo work, he released collaborative albums such as Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi.

                        
                        West holds the joint record (with Bob Dylan) for the most albums (4) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Inc., Louis Vuitton, Gap Inc., and A.P.C. on clothing and footwear. He also led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas.

                        West is widely regarded as one of the most critically acclaimed popular music artists of the 21st century, receiving praise from music critics, industry peers, and cultural figures. In 2014, NME named him the third most influential artist in music. Billboard senior editor Alex Gale declared West as "absolutely one of the best, and you could make the argument for the best artist of the 21st century." Sharing similar sentiments, Dave Bry of Complex Magazine called West the twenty-first century's "most important artist of any art form, of any genre.
